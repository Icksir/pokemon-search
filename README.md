First time ever I worked with an REST API. This was made in my second semester in college.

You can search Pokémons by name and by id. "Siguiente" will show the next Pokémon according to their Pokédex ID, and "Anterior" will show the previous one.

You can also select the normal or the shiny version of the Pokémon.
